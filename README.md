## Newton's Method for Solving Equations _f(x) = 0_

Assuming f has a continous derivative, we can solve the equation _f(x) = 0_ using Newton's method.
The idea is that we approximate the graph by following the tangent in a point until we cross the x-axis.
We continue iterating from this value until a converging to a solution with a satisfactory error rate.
